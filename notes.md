## Deployment Notes
- Setup the server
- Make the port dynamic
    - const port = process.env.PORT
        - process and env are both objects
        - think of them as the computer that is running the program



## steps - Setup/Config

- create an empty repository on Github
- clone it 
- open it in VS Code
- create default package.json
    - npm init -y 
        - "-y" says, "Give me the defaults."
- npm install express
    - 'git status' -> 'node-modules' shows up on the list

- npx gitignore node --> generates a gitignore file 

- Installing development dependencies with npm
    - npm install -D <the name of the package>
